# Distinguishing Sentiments
Homework Week 7 - News Mood

This assignment uses Python libraries and the Tweepy API to perform a sentiment analysis and provide a visualized summary of the sentiments expressed in Tweets sent out by the following news organizations: BBC, CBS, CNN, Fox, and New York Times.

* Observations
    * One 
    * Two
    * Three 

```python
# Dependencies
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import json
import tweepy
from datetime import datetime
```


```python
# Twitter API Keys
import os
consumer_key = os.getenv("twitter_consumer_key")
consumer_secret = os.getenv("twitter_consumer_secret")
access_token = os.getenv("twitter_access_token_key")
access_token_secret = os.getenv("twitter_access_token_secret")
```


```python
# Setup Tweepy API Authentication
auth = tweepy.OAuthHandler(consumer_key, consumer_secret)
auth.set_access_token(access_token, access_token_secret)
api = tweepy.API(auth, parser=tweepy.parsers.JSONParser())
```


```python
# Import and Initialize Sentiment Analyzer
from vaderSentiment.vaderSentiment import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer
analyzer = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()
```


```python
# Create array with news outlet twitter handles
    #newsOutlets = ["BBCWorld", "nytimes"]
newsOutlets = ["BBCWorld", "CBSNews","CNN", "FoxNews", "nytimes"]
```


```python
# print a single tweet json for reference
test_tweet = api.user_timeline(newsOutlets[0])
print(json.dumps(test_tweet[0], sort_keys=True, indent=4))
```
